## Render and commit

Like React, tap splits work into two phases:

1. **Render** — the resource function runs, hooks record their data, and a return value is produced. This phase has no side effects.
2. **Commit** — effects whose dependencies changed run. If an effect is re-running, its previous cleanup executes first. The resource is considered mounted after this phase.

```ts
const App = resource(() => {
  // --- render phase ---
  const [count, setCount] = tapState(0);

  tapEffect(() => {
    // --- commit phase ---
    console.log(`Mounted with count: ${count}`);
    return () => console.log("Cleaned up");
  }, [count]);

  return { count };
});
```

### Effect ordering

In React, effects run children-first, then parents (inside-out). This is because components can only render children by returning them — there's no way to run an effect after a child's effects.

In tap, **effects run in the exact order they are called during the render pass**. Since `tapResource` is just another hook, you can place `tapEffect` calls before or after it:

```ts
const Parent = resource(() => {
  tapEffect(() => {
    console.log("1: before child");
  });

  const child = tapResource(Child());

  tapEffect(() => {
    console.log("3: after child");
  });

  return child;
});

const Child = resource(() => {
  tapEffect(() => {
    console.log("2: child");
  });
});
// Mount order: 1, 2, 3
```

This is intentional — it lets you run setup logic both before and after children, which is useful when a parent needs to react to data provided by a child.

Cleanup on unmount runs in the same order as mount (FIFO), matching the order effects were originally registered.

## Mount and unmount

A resource is **mounted** after its first commit. At this point, effects have run and the resource is live.

A resource is **unmounted** when its owner removes it — all effect cleanups run and the resource is disposed. This happens automatically when:

- A parent resource stops rendering the child via `tapResource`
- A React component using `useResource` unmounts
- `handle.unmount()` is called on a `createResource` handle

## Concurrent mode

<Callout type="warn">
Concurrent mode support is coming soon.
</Callout>

## Strict mode

In development, tap supports React-style strict mode. When enabled, resources render twice on mount to help detect side effects in the render phase.

- **`useResource`** inherits React's strict mode setting automatically — if your component is inside `<StrictMode>`, the resource runs in strict mode too.
- **`createResource`** lets you opt in explicitly via the `devStrictMode` option:

```ts
const handle = createResource(Counter(), { devStrictMode: true });
```

This is the same behavior as React's `<StrictMode>` — double-rendering helps surface unintentional side effects during the render phase.
