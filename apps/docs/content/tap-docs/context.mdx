description: Pass values through resource boundaries without prop drilling.

<Callout type="warn">
The context API is experimental and not yet stable. It may change significantly in a future version.
</Callout>

Context lets you pass values through the resource tree without threading props through every level — the same idea as React's `createContext` / `useContext`.

## createResourceContext

Create a context with a default value.

```ts
import { createResourceContext } from "@assistant-ui/tap";

const ThemeContext = createResourceContext("light");
```

## Reading context

Read the current value of a context inside a resource with `tap`.

```ts
import { tap } from "@assistant-ui/tap";

const Button = resource(() => {
  const theme = tap(ThemeContext);
  // ...
});
```

## withContextProvider

Provide a context value to all resources rendered within the callback.

```ts
import { withContextProvider } from "@assistant-ui/tap";

const App = resource(() => {
  const child = withContextProvider(ThemeContext, "dark", () => {
    return tapResource(Button());
  });

  return child;
});
```

Any resource rendered inside the callback — including deeply nested children — will read `"dark"` from `ThemeContext`.

<Callout type="warn">
Context is not properly persisted across `tapResourceRoot` boundaries. If a child resource is wrapped with `tapResourceRoot`, it may not see context values provided by its ancestors. This is a known bug.
</Callout>
