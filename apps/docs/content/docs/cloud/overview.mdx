description: Add thread persistence and chat history to your AI app in minutes.
---

Assistant Cloud is a hosted service that adds thread management, message persistence, and user authorization to AI chat applications. It works with any React UI—whether you use assistant-ui components or your own.

## What You Get

- **Thread Persistence** — Messages automatically save as conversations progress. Users can resume chats at any time, even across sessions.
- **Thread List** — Built-in UI components (or hooks) for browsing, switching, and managing conversations.
- **Auto-Generated Titles** — Conversations get meaningful titles based on the initial messages.
- **Human-in-the-Loop** — Support for interrupted agent workflows where execution pauses for user input.
- **User Authorization** — Integrates with your auth provider to scope threads per user or workspace.
