title: Text-to-Speech (Speech Synthesis)
description: Read messages aloud with Web Speech API or custom TTS.
---

import { SpeechSample } from "@/components/docs/samples/speech";

assistant-ui supports text-to-speech via the `SpeechSynthesisAdapter` interface.

<SpeechSample />

## SpeechSynthesisAdapter

Currently, the following speech synthesis adapters are supported:

- `WebSpeechSynthesisAdapter`: Uses the browser's `Web Speech API`

Support for other speech synthesis adapters is planned for the future.

Passing a `SpeechSynthesisAdapter` to the runtime will enable text-to-speech support.

## UI

By default, a `Read aloud` button will be shown in the assistant message action bar.

This is implemented using `AssistantActionBar.SpeechControl` which is a wrapper around `AssistantActionBar.Speak` and `AssistantActionBar.StopSpeaking`.
The underlying primitives are `ActionBarPrimitive.Speak` and `ActionBarPrimitive.StopSpeaking`.

## Example

The following example uses the `WebSpeechSynthesisAdapter`.

```tsx
import { WebSpeechSynthesisAdapter } from "@assistant-ui/react";

const runtime = useChatRuntime({
  api: "/api/chat",
  adapters: {
    speech: new WebSpeechSynthesisAdapter(),
  },
});
```
