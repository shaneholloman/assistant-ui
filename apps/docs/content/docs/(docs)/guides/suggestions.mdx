Suggestions are pre-defined prompts that help users discover what your assistant can do. They appear in the welcome screen and provide a quick way to start conversations.

## Overview

The Suggestions API allows you to configure a list of suggested prompts that are displayed when the thread is empty. Users can click on a suggestion to either populate the composer or immediately send the message.

## Quick Start

Configure suggestions using the `Suggestions()` API in your runtime provider:

```tsx
import { useAui, Tools, Suggestions } from "@assistant-ui/react";
import { useChatRuntime } from "@assistant-ui/react-ai-sdk";

function MyRuntimeProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const runtime = useChatRuntime();

  const aui = useAui({
    tools: Tools({ toolkit: myToolkit }),
    suggestions: Suggestions([
      "What can you help me with?",
      "Tell me a joke",
      "Explain quantum computing",
    ]),
  });

  return (
    <AssistantRuntimeProvider aui={aui} runtime={runtime}>
      {children}
    </AssistantRuntimeProvider>
  );
}
```

## Suggestion Format

Suggestions can be provided as either strings or objects with title, label, and prompt:

### Simple Strings

```tsx
const aui = useAui({
  suggestions: Suggestions([
    "What's the weather today?",
    "Help me write an email",
    "Explain React hooks",
  ]),
});
```

### Objects with Title and Description

For more detailed suggestions with separate display text and prompts:

```tsx
const aui = useAui({
  suggestions: Suggestions([
    {
      title: "Weather",
      label: "in San Francisco",
      prompt: "What's the weather in San Francisco?",
    },
    {
      title: "React Hooks",
      label: "useState and useEffect",
      prompt: "Explain React hooks like useState and useEffect",
    },
    {
      title: "Travel Tips",
      label: "for Tokyo",
      prompt: "Give me travel tips for visiting Tokyo",
    },
  ]),
});
```

## Displaying Suggestions

The default Thread component from the shadcn registry already includes suggestion rendering. The suggestions are displayed in the welcome screen when the thread is empty.

### Customizing Suggestion Display

If you want to customize how suggestions are displayed, you can modify your Thread component:

```tsx
import {
  ThreadPrimitive,
  SuggestionPrimitive,
  AuiIf,
} from "@assistant-ui/react";

const ThreadWelcome = () => {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>How can I help you today?</p>

      {/* Display suggestions */}
      <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
        <ThreadPrimitive.Suggestions
          components={{
            Suggestion: SuggestionItem,
          }}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

const SuggestionItem = () => {
  return (
    <SuggestionPrimitive.Trigger send asChild>
      <button className="rounded-lg border p-3 hover:bg-muted">
        <div className="font-medium">
          <SuggestionPrimitive.Title />
        </div>
        <div className="text-muted-foreground text-sm">
          <SuggestionPrimitive.Description />
        </div>
      </button>
    </SuggestionPrimitive.Trigger>
  );
};
```

## Suggestion Primitives

### ThreadPrimitive.Suggestions

Renders all suggestions from the suggestions scope.

```tsx
<ThreadPrimitive.Suggestions
  components={{
    Suggestion: CustomSuggestionComponent,
  }}
/>
```

### SuggestionPrimitive.Title

Displays the suggestion's title (the first part when using object format, or the full text when using strings).

```tsx
<SuggestionPrimitive.Title />
```

### SuggestionPrimitive.Description

Displays the suggestion's description/label (only shown when using object format).

```tsx
<SuggestionPrimitive.Description />
```

### SuggestionPrimitive.Trigger

A button that triggers the suggestion action when clicked.

```tsx
<SuggestionPrimitive.Trigger
  send={true}
  clearComposer={true}
  asChild
>
  <button>Click me</button>
</SuggestionPrimitive.Trigger>
```

**Props:**

- `send` (boolean): When true, automatically sends the message. When false, only populates the composer.
- `clearComposer` (boolean, default: true): When `send` is false, determines if the composer is cleared before adding the suggestion (true) or if the suggestion is appended (false).
- `asChild` (boolean): Merge props with child element instead of rendering a button.

## Dynamic Suggestions

You can dynamically change suggestions based on your application state:

```tsx
import { useMemo } from "react";

function MyRuntimeProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const runtime = useChatRuntime();
  const user = useUser(); // Your user hook

  const suggestions = useMemo(() => {
    if (user.isPremium) {
      return [
        "Analyze my business data",
        "Generate a detailed report",
        "Create a custom workflow",
      ];
    }
    return [
      "What can you do?",
      "Tell me a joke",
      "Help me get started",
    ];
  }, [user.isPremium]);

  const aui = useAui({
    tools: Tools({ toolkit: myToolkit }),
    suggestions: Suggestions(suggestions),
  });

  return (
    <AssistantRuntimeProvider aui={aui} runtime={runtime}>
      {children}
    </AssistantRuntimeProvider>
  );
}
```

## Context-Aware Suggestions

Suggestions can be tailored to different contexts or user intents:

```tsx
const suggestions = [
  {
    title: "Code Review",
    label: "Get feedback on your code",
    prompt: "Can you review this code for me?",
  },
  {
    title: "Debug Help",
    label: "Find and fix issues",
    prompt: "Help me debug this error",
  },
  {
    title: "Best Practices",
    label: "Learn recommended patterns",
    prompt: "What are the best practices for this?",
  },
];
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep suggestions concise**: Use clear, actionable prompts that users can understand at a glance
2. **Show capabilities**: Use suggestions to highlight your assistant's key features
3. **Provide variety**: Offer suggestions across different use cases
4. **Use the object format for complex suggestions**: When you need separate title/description, use the object format
5. **Limit the number**: 3-6 suggestions work best to avoid overwhelming users
6. **Make them actionable**: Each suggestion should lead to a meaningful interaction

## Migration from Legacy API

If you're using the deprecated `ThreadPrimitive.Suggestion` component, migrate to the new API:

### Before (Deprecated)

```tsx
<ThreadPrimitive.Suggestion
  prompt="What's the weather?"
  send
/>
```

### After (Recommended)

1. Configure suggestions in your runtime provider:

```tsx
const aui = useAui({
  suggestions: Suggestions(["What's the weather?"]),
});
```

2. Display suggestions using the primitives:

```tsx
<ThreadPrimitive.Suggestions
  components={{
    Suggestion: SuggestionItem,
  }}
/>
```

The new API provides:
- **Centralized configuration**: Define suggestions once in your runtime provider
- **Better separation of concerns**: Configuration separate from presentation
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support
- **Consistency**: Follows the same pattern as the Tools API
